# WebApiCourse

January 2022 I finished the Udemy course 'Complete Guide to ASP.NET Core RESTful API with Blazor WASM' (certificate of completion). Following the course a RESTful API was created form scrap (learned about routing, model binding, model validation, filter pipeline). I also learned testing it using Postman / Swagger UI, added Entity framework and finally built a full Blazor WebAssembly app using multiple authentication methods. This is the complete and final code.
